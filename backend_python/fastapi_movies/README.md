## FastAPI Movies + SQLAlchemy

I completed a pet project that allows you to get movies data from a database. 

The "Films" project was implemented on the basis of **FastAPI+ SQLAlchemy(SQLite)**.


Why did I do it?
It was important for me to figure out how backend applications are written in Python, if a business needs to solve a similar problem, so that in the future I donâ€™t waste time learning a new tool from scratch. It will never be superfluous!

Surely you will find the best solution for implementing similar applications based on **FastAPI+ SQLAlchemy**, I'm not a professional, but just an amateur who does it in his spare time and who is interested in it.
It is important for me to develop and acquire new knowledge.
