**PySpark**

This is a very powerful tool that I would like to use on a regular basis. It allows you to process more data than the RAM of the machine + can process data on several machines, yet Pandas does not have such an option.
1) cars_prices: I have processed a csv file related to the sale of cars. I selected the fields I needed and did the aggregation.
